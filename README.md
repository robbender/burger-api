My Burger Tutorial Api

*I updated the name to be different for Heroku.*

First make sure you have a Heroku account.

(https://www.heroku.com/home)

Heroku Terminal Commands:

```console
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```

You may have to login first.

You also may need to have heroku-node in your PATH, run:

  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/heroku-node/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  
After installation you may want to check the version of Heroku

```console
heroku --version
```
Next run this in the terminal:

```console
heroku create [name-of-the-app]
```
After your app has been created on Heroku, push your project.
```console
git push heroku main
```
```console
heroku open
```
Hello everyone! In this weeks video I show you how to make your own mock version of an API and deploy it onto the internet in just a few easy steps. This is a super stripped down version, so has no routing/controllers. This is thanks to the https://github.com/typicode/json-serverâ€‹ package. Where you can get a mock REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds.

For those of you wishing to check it out live visit [here](https://my-burger-api.herokuapp.com/)

A lot of you are wondering if you can interact with this database. Yes you can. You can make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc requests to it. You can even get an individual burger. For example if I want to get the Tribute Burger, which has an ID of 0, I would write: 

```
fetch('https://my-burger-api.herokuapp.com/burgers/0')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

For those of you who would like to add a burger to my database, please make a pull request here, following the same format as discussed on [this video.](https://youtu.be/FLnxgSZ0DG4)
